## Description

Brain Games is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly.

Games:

Definition of an even number.
Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated.
Determination of the greatest common divisor.
Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
Definition of a prime number.
